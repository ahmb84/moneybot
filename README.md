# MoneyBot

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elsehow/moneybot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elsehow/moneybot)

MoneyBot allows you to backtest trading strategies, and deploy these strategies to live-trade, without changing code.

For now, MoneyBot only supports Poloniex. However, a generic `MarketAdapter` pattern could allow trading over many exchanges. PRs welcome!

# install

First, install Python dependencies.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, set up the Postgres database and restore the historical data. We provide scripts to automate this process with Docker:

```
cd local-services/postgresql
make image
make server
bash restore.sh
```

# use

Make sure Portgres is running (`cd local-services/postgresql; make server`).

There are a few `Strategy` implementations in `moneybot.examples.strategies`.

>The strategies included herein are viable for live-trading use, but crypto trading is serious business. It's entirely possible to lose a lot of money, very quickly. The authors of this library provide these for the sake of illustration and assume no responsibility for their performance if deployed.

## backtesting

```
python3 examples/backtest.py -c config.yml -s buffed-coin
```

## live trading

**NOTE**: See disclaimer!

To live-trade, you will need Poloniex API keys. You can generate those via the [Poloniex web interface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OScIbgXZoW0). You'll only need to allow "trading" permissions on the keys. See the `config-example.yaml` file, add your Poloniex credentials and save it as `config.yml`.

```
python3 examples/live_trading.py -c config.yml -s buffed-coin
```

# disclaimer

Use MoneyBot AT YOUR OWN RISK. Specifically,

- Backtests are no guarantee of future/live performance.
- MoneyBot relies on 3rd-party APIs, like Poloniex, which may fail at anytime.
- MoneyBot is experimental software, and also may fail at any time.
- Running a bot, and trading in general, requires careful study of the risks, and parameters. Wrong settings can cause a major loss.
- Never leave MoneyBot un-monitored for long periods of time. Be prepared to stop it if too much loss occurs.

*You alone* are responsible for anything that happens when you're live-trading!
